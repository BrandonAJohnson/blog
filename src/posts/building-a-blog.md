<h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">So How Did We Get Here Exactly?</h2>
<p class="mb-4">
	If you told me pre-COVID, I would be building a blog site or just writing blogs in general, I would have laughed out loud.
	I was an advancing Web Developer working on a Special Education Management platform that actually felt like I was making something that helped people.
	I honestly felt like I had settled into my career and was comfortable just doing the best at the company I was at. I didn't have anything meaningful to
	add to the software industry or the world or really anything beyond my own family. So why?
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
	Well everything was changing. The single most disruptive influence in business worldwide ever had occurred. Businesses that never would have thought of
	letting employees work from home were now fully remote, in face meetings turned to Zoom calls, Zoom calls turned to emails, and emails turned to IMs. The
	landscape of what we knew about the Tech industry had shifted. This brought about many progressive changes one of which was the accessibility to other companies
	that were previously out of reach unless you wanted to move your entire family across the country.

<p class="mb-4">
	On top of that advancements in AI were/are booming. We are now seeing its influence in development, and I think the next wave of programming language shifts is coming.
	High level languages will be a thing of the past, replaced by a higher level that abstracts programming to a new level. With this comes the fear for many that the field
	for programmers will be condensing. No, we will never be completely rid of developers, but companies will start to require less developers to do the same amount of work.
	This compounded with the the remote workforce has saw a huge decline in the industry for developer jobs.
</p>

<p class="mb-4">
	As a first generation college graduate who thought he was getting away from the small towns in WV, this is a critical time in my career. I can pretend that everything
	will be find and settle into a career that may or may not need me one day or I can work to improve myself. I chose the latter.
